# Keylogger
# Overview
This is a simple keylogger project built using Python. The keylogger captures keystrokes and stores them in a log file for later analysis. This project was created for educational purposes to understand how keyboard events can be intercepted in Python.

# Features
- Records all keystrokes on the user's keyboard.
- Saves captured keystrokes into a log file in real-time.
- Written in Python using libraries like pynput for capturing keyboard input.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pynput library: Install it using pip install pynput
 
# How It Works
This keylogger uses the pynput library to listen to keyboard events. Whenever a key is pressed, it is captured and written to a log file. You can specify the path of the log file where the keystrokes will be saved.

# Caution
This project should be used responsibly and ethically. Unauthorized use of keyloggers may violate privacy laws or terms of service agreements. Make sure to use this project only in environments where you have permission to do so, such as personal machines or educational settings.
